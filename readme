## Improvements

Here are some areas for improvement:
  * Add some unit tests
  * Split out the files a bit more to make it a bit more reusable
  * Set up some constants for things like "Queued", "Conlcuded" etc...
  * Dockerize it.
  * Setup the makefile to run
  * Setup an API document such as a swagger.
  * Could add authentication/authorization stuff.

Here are some code changes I would like to make if I had more time/would like to consider some tradeoffs
 * I wouldn't like to assign the job ID as the order of which it is put into the queue.
 * Do we need to? It seems like there should be an ability to prioritize something or push it to the front of the queue if needed, since there is a time_critical element
 * I would like to actually remove the concluded and already processed jobs from the queue instead of keeping them there for historical reference.
 *
